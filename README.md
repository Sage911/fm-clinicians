The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with React and Redux. The application also utilizes a redux-form to submit information to our database hosted by Firebase. 

It utilizes hot reloading, and eventually react-router-dom for our different pages. The goal is to connect this React application to a Rails API that will handle our database.
